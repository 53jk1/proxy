# Proxy Design Pattern
## Intent
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Also known as
Surrogate

## Applicability
Use the Proxy pattern in any of the following situations:
* A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object in a different address space.
* A virtual proxy creates expensive objects on demand.
* A protection proxy controls access to the original object. Protection proxies are useful when objects should have different access rights.
